**Challenges faced & solutions used:**

1. One of the earliest challenges the team faced was connecting the front-end to the backend. We started off using handlebars until we realized we were not able to use the logic we needed. The problem was, if a user drank 3 cups, left the app, and then came back to log in more cups, how do we make sure the cups stay at 3 and do not refresh. We needed to implement if statements in the html.
